NAME
	deadman - software deadman's switch

SYNOPSIS
	deadman time cmd [arg...]

DESCRIPTION
	deadman is a software deadman's switch. It sits as a sleeping daemon,
	then runs a command at the specified time.

	Stop the switch by sending the SIGKILL signal, since deadman ignores all
	possible signals and SIGKILL cannot be ignored.

	Time is in UTC, parsed in the format "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss" similar to
	ISO 8601. For example: "2019-08-05T15:35:00".

	Command must be an absolute path starting with "/".

NOTES
	While deadman tries to position itself to avoid interruption by the
	system, it does not go to the extent that some malware does, like
	modifying the system to avoid detection.

	Be aware that:

	* On Linux, if /proc is not mounted with hidepid=2, unprivileged users
	may see the time and command deadman will run.

	* If the OS does not have DoS limits in place it could be possible for
	other processes to consume all system resources and deadman would be
	unable to execute the command. In such a scenario, the OS may
	automatically kill deadman to reappropriate resources.

	* When the system loses power deadman will be killed with everything
	else.

	* Users such as root or those in the wheel group may kill or alter
	deadman's execution.
